# Flying Fingers — Tasks

> Rolling execution backlog. Keep `Now` to 1–2 items. Move items as reality changes. `plan.md` is the spec; this file is the workbench.

## Now

- [ ] **Wire Options.tsx** — assemble TabContainer + Dashboard/Practice/Settings tabs
  - Options component manages activeTab state + onChange handler
  - Integrates tracker/session-log.ts → Dashboard for real data
  - localStorage sync for tab preference persistence
  - chrome.storage.local binding for UserSettings (read on mount, write on Settings onChange)

## Later

- [ ] Build the options page: dashboard, practice, stats, settings
- [ ] Implement the WPM-over-time chart on the stats page
- [ ] Write 8+ built-in practice passages
- [ ] Add dark mode theme
- [ ] Wire up Settings → Advanced → "Enable custom practice passages" toggle
- [ ] Add "Custom Passage" flow with destination selector and time estimate warning
- [ ] Implement typo simulation (`engine/errors.ts`)
- [ ] Add fatigue curve to engine
- [ ] Add cognitive pauses at sentence boundaries
- [ ] Write sideload instructions (Mac/Windows/Chromebook) in README
- [ ] Test on all three platforms
- [ ] Add a generic contenteditable/input adapter (`adapters/generic.ts`) for non-GDocs sites
- [ ] Write `docs/specifications/` page (cover-story framing)
- [ ] Write `docs/design/typing-engine.md` (internal — may reference real intent)
- [ ] Write ADR for the adapter pattern choice
- [ ] Investigate Chrome Web Store submission (optional, deferred)

## Done

- [x] **`ui/options/Settings.tsx` — Settings tab (TDD)** — RED→GREEN cycle. 12/12 tests passing, typecheck clean.

Commit `8f5e26c`. (2026-04-12)
- [x] **`tracker/passages.ts` — built-in passage library** — 9 passages covering prose, technical, quotes. Passage interface with id/name/text/difficulty. `getPassageById()` + `getAllPassages()` API. Commit `8f5e26c`. (2026-04-12)
- [x] **`ui/options/Dashboard.tsx` — stats display (TDD)** — RED→GREEN cycle. 11/11 tests passing, typecheck clean.

- [x] **`tracker/observer.ts` — real-keystroke tracking (TDD)** — RED→GREEN cycle. 14/14 tests passing, typecheck clean. Stateless session observer: records WPM, accuracy, char/error counts. Commit `a61096b`. (2026-04-12)
- [x] **`tracker/ranks.ts` — XP math + rank progression (TDD)** — RED→GREEN cycle. 26/26 tests passing, typecheck clean. calculateXp formula, rank tier lookup, progression tracking. Exponential thresholds (100 * tier^1.8). Commit `12c7d0a`. (2026-04-12)

- [x] **Scaffolded the real project** — Vite + TypeScript + Preact + `@crxjs/vite-plugin@^2.0.4` + Dexie + Vitest. `npm install`, `npm run build`, `npm run typecheck` all green. Committed as `c7b53d6` on `main` (not pushed). Research recorded in `context.md` (4 sources). Uses TS `manifest.config.ts` with `defineManifest` rather than plain JSON. (2026-04-09)
- [x] **Validated the Google Docs injection technique** — spike v0.0.3 successfully typed 85 characters into a live Google Doc using `textInput` event dispatched to the inner contenteditable inside `iframe.docs-texteventtarget-iframe`. Three earlier iterations were needed: v0.0.1 failed on popup focus loss, v0.0.2 failed because top-level `document.execCommand` can't reach into iframe-owned editables, v0.0.3 crossed the iframe boundary and found the working technique (Path C: legacy `textInput` event). Full details and the exact code to lift into the real adapter recorded in `context.md`. (2026-04-08)
